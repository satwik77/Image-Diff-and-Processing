    "I have included various approaches to the project idea.\n",
    "Following are the proof of concepts for some features that I would like to implement and their corresponding python scripts which can be used for its implementation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Keeping in mind the whole idea of an image-analyzer in peragro-AT, there are various image processing features that can be included in the core peragro-AT, the image diff being the major one.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various image processing libraries which can be used to implement image diff, like python imaging library(PIL) being the most common one, scikit-image one of the most widely used tools for implementation of various type of analytic features, imgdiff and imagemagick library. Wand is a ctypes-based ImagedMagick binding library for python and pythonmagick is an object-oriented python interface to ImageMagick.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have used scikit-image and PIL before and I am familiar with wand, so I would focus on implementing in skimage and PIL.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various features that we can implement in the peragro-AT's image analyzer along with image diff:\n",
    " * Image differencing, the major one\n",
    " * Similarity index between images(using various approaches like RMS, SSIM, MSE)\n",
    " * Extracting as much meta-data from images as possible\n",
    " * Other features such as image noising and denoising(improves quality, specially used for satellite images)\n",
    " * Blob detection(extreme bright or dark features in an image)\n",
    " * And ofcourse exception handling( It has to be everywhere, doesn't need much explanation )\n",

    "There can be more such features once the major ones are implemented.\n",
    "Plugins can be made, so that whoever uses the analyzer has more control on the features they want in it. For example currently I have thought of implementing Blob detection as a plugin using the yapsy package, which is also currently used in peragro-AT. \n",
    "\n",
    "Keeping in mind the scope of the project and its future development, I would suggest using scikit-image as there are lot of image manipulations that can be done with it. Though most of the things which can be done using PIL can be done in scikit-image and both of theirs source code are majorly written in C, so they are likely to have insignificant performance differences. Thus I would go with using scikit-image along with numpy and other required modules so that in future, there is more scope of implementing various image processing features.\n",
